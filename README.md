### Hey! Welcome to my profile ðŸ˜„

My name is **Tyler Stennett** and I'm a second-year computer science student and undergraduate research assistant at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

## Repositories

ðŸ’» I'm currently working on a research project involving innovative automated REST API testing solutions for upcoming software engineering conferences.

ðŸ““ I've previously worked on research projects like RESTGPT, which was accepted for publication by ICSE NIER 2024. Feel free to read over the associated paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00894.pdf)!

I have some repositories on my profile that I've used for learning different areas of software engineering, like a convenient light-weight College Scheduler Android application.

Thanks for reading and feel free to reach out!
