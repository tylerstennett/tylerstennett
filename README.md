### Hey! Welcome to my profile 😅

My name is Tyler Stennett and I'm a computer science student and undergraduate research assistant at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

💻 I'm currently working on a research project involving innovative automated REST API testing solutions.

📓 I've previously worked on research projects like RESTGPT, which was accepted for publication by ICSE NIER 2024. Feel free to read over the associated paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00894.pdf)!

I have some repositories on my profile that I've used for learning different areas of software engineering, like a convenient College Scheduler Android application and a fencing forum website.

Thanks for reading and feel free to reach out!
