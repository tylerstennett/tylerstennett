### Hey! Welcome to my profile ðŸ˜„

My name is **Tyler Stennett** and I'm a third-year computer science student and undergraduate research assistant at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*. Formerly a member of Georgia Tech's Software Engineering (SE) Lab, and currently a member of Georgia Tech's Computational Behavior Analysis (CBA) Lab.

## Repositories

ðŸ’» I'm currently working on a research project in the field of human activity recognition involving change point detection for smart home sensor data through supervised and unsupervised learning.

ðŸ““ I've previously conducted research in automated software testing through machine learning and LLMs. My past projects include [RESTGPT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00894.pdf), published in ICSE-NIER 2024, and [AutoRestTest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07098), accepted in ICSE 2025.

I have some repositories on my profile that I've used for learning different areas of software engineering, like a convenient light-weight College Scheduler Android application.

Thanks for reading and feel free to reach out!
