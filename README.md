### Hey! Welcome to my profile ðŸ˜„

My name is **Tyler Stennett**, and I'm a first-year Master's student in computer science and a researcher at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*. I'm currently a member of Georgia Tech's Software Engineering (SE) Lab, advised by Professor Alessandro Orso - having previously been part of the [Computational Behavior Analysis (CBA) Lab](https://cba.gatech.edu/), advised by Professor Thomas PlÃ¶tz. I also served as a graduate research intern at IBM Research during the summer.

ðŸ’» I'm currently working on two projects focused on AI for software testing.

ðŸ““ My past research includes automated software testing through machine learning and LLMs, with projects like **RESTGPT**, published in [ICSE-NIER 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00894.pdf), and **AutoRestTest**, accepted as a research paper in [ICSE 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07098) and as a demonstration paper in [ICSE-Demo 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08600). I've also conducted research in human activity recognition for my completed undergraduate thesis, involving change point detection for smart home sensor data using supervised and unsupervised learning.

Thanks for reading, and feel free to reach out!
